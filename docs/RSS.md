# RSS

- [GitHub - DIYgod/RSSHub: ðŸ§¡ Everything is RSSible](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub)
- Limiting RSShub feed size to 10 items:

```shell
https://rsshub.app/dribbble/popular?limit=10
```

- In their official [instance](https://rsshub.app/) they have `CACHE_EXPIRE` value set to `5*60`. This means that I can get RSS feed from specific source only every 5 hours. To overcome this maybe I should additionally use [RSS-bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) or host my own instance.
